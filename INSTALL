odopoi Installation Guide
=========================

WARNING: this is *BETA* software under active development. Some of the 
"gum and ducttape" is still around from the initial prototype.

System Requirements
-------------------

You'll need an apache 2.x web server configured with PHP 5.x and MySQL 
5.x. The program that extracts the points of interest from the OSM 
files, named posm_extractor, needs to be compiled. You'll need a C 
compiler (gcc), expat library, and cmake. A future version will require 
pthreads.

Getting the Source Code
-----------------------

$ git clone git://github.com/tcort/odopoi.gi

Configure Apache
----------------

Set the document root to be /path/to/odopoi/www

Permissions
-----------

Make /path/to/odopoi/www/cache readable and writable by the web server user.

Database Configuration
----------------------

Create a MySQL database and a MySQL user with permissions to access it.

Edit the /path/to/odopoi/www/config.php file.

Download some OSM data
----------------------

Get one or more OSM files. There are a few sources:

 * http://planet.openstreetmap.org/
 * http://downloads.cloudmade.com/
 * http://www.openstreetmap.org/ (Export as "OpenStreetMap XML Data")

They can be put anywhere, but /path/to/odopoi/posm_extractor/data is the best.

Compile posm_extractor
----------------------

$ cd /path/to/odopoi/posm_extractor
$ ./build-native.sh

Extract POI from your OSM files in /path/to/odopoi/posm_extractor/data
----------------------------------------------------------------------

$ cd /path/to/odopoi/posm_extractor
$ ./run.sh > extract.sql

Load the extract into MySQL
---------------------------

$ mysql -u your_username_here -p your_database_name_here < extract.sql

Run some data Cleanups
----------------------

These are processes left over from the early days of development, but 
are pretty easy to run. symbol-check.php removes any points of interest 
that don't have icons or are malformed. zoom-calc.php computes at what 
zoom level points are displayed on the map so that the icons don't 
overlap with other icons.

$ cd /path/to/odopoi/utl
$ php symbol-check.php
$ php zoom-calc.php

symbol-check.php should take about 30 seconds to run.
zoom-calc.php may take 20 to 30 minutes on Canada-sized data sets.

The End
-------

That should be it. Feel free to e-mail me questions and/or improvements.
